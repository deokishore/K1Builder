I am currently living in Ireland and urgently needed a plumber to fix a major 
leak and to fit a new bathroom suite in my tenants flat. After carefully 
searching Checkatrade I came across K1 Builders and was 
impressed by the reviews. Due to being so far away and not being able to oversee 
the work I need a trusted company, and thankfully that is exactly what I got! 
Freddie kept me fully up to date with all work being carried out by suppling me 
with regular emails, photos and phone calls. He also supplied all the materials 
(i.E. New bath) without any qualms. I have seen the finished result and can't 
believe its the same bathroom. My tenants are really pleased with their new 
bathroom and fed back to me that TLBC were professional, polite and 
accommodating throughout. I feel lucky to have stumbled across a great building 
company that I can rely on in the future. Top marks for Freddie and the team!

We asked a number of people for quotes and got what we considered to be a 
sensible and realistic quote for a fairly extensive refurbishment of our house 
from Freddie. Freddie and his team did an excellent job and exceeded our 
expectations. They involved us in decisions about the property, approach to the 
work and specification. They were very flexible and easily accommodated our 
requests for extra work. The work has been done to the highest professional 
standard in a very friendly, courteous and timely fashion. Freddie's whole team 
assembled themselves outside of our house ten minutes before start time. They 
were all very friendly. The things that impressed us most was the fact that 
Freddie remembers every detail and takes personal responsibility for making sure 
that you, the client, are completely satisfied with the work that you want done. 
I have worked with lots of building companies on different projects over the 
years. Freddie is probably the best that I have worked with and I have no 
hesitation in recommending him. Catch him if you can!
