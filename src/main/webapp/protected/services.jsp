It is a myth that tanking is the answer to all wetroom issues; it is vital that the finished surface is non-porous and this is particularly hard to achieve with stone as the sealers wear off very quickly. The worst materials to choose for a bespoke shower tray or wetroom are limestone, slate and travertine, as they are permeable and go considerably softer when wet.</p>

                                             <p>Rather than extending, a couple have reconfigured what they already have. For home owners wanting extra living space, the tendency is to increase the size of the building. But sometimes you need to think inside the box, instead of out of it. That was the dilemma facing Neutral Bay residents Paula and Nick Fletcher when it came time to updating their family’s ageing red-brick house on 481 square metres.  The couple have two energetic sons, aged four and eight, and ”needed a decent-size garden” for them, Paula says. But they also wanted more room to move inside their house..</p>
